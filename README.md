# Verseforge
The VerseForge Web App is a user-friendly platform designed to assist musicians, songwriters, and enthusiasts in creating song lyrics with ease and flexibility. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app incorporates an interactive chat interface that enables users to receive AI-generated lyrics based on their input. The unique feature of the app lies in its editor page, which allows users to refine the generated lyrics, making it a valuable tool for both novice and professional lyricists. The app’s workflow is designed to be intuitive. Users initiate a conversation with the bot on the chat page, entering prompts or themes for lyrics generation. The bot contains an “Edit” button which, when clicked, opens the lyrics in the editor page. In the editor, users have access to various editing tools to personalize the content. Once satisfied, users can download the final lyrics as a PDF, making it convenient to save and share their creations.
